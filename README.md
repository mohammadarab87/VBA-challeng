I will use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data .

# Instructions :

1- Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

** The ticker symbol

** Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

** The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

** The total stock volume of the stock .

2- I also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.


3- Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".


4- Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.
